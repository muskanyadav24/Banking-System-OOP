  - Personal Loans (8-15% interest)
  - Home Loans (6-9% interest)
  - Car Loans (7-12% interest)
  - Business Loans (10-18% interest)

- **Loan Operations:**
  - Apply for loans with automatic approval
  - Calculate monthly payments using compound interest formula
  - Make loan payments with automatic interest/principal breakdown
  - View detailed loan information
  - Display payment schedules
  - Track payment history
  - Automatic loan closure when fully paid

- **Advanced Features:**
  - Integration with bank accounts (loan funds deposited, payments deducted)

## Key Loan Management Functions

### Loan Creation
```cpp
void applyForLoan()
```
- Validates account existence
- Offers different loan types with preset rates
- Calculates monthly payments automatically
- Deposits loan amount to linked account

### Payment Processing
```cpp
void makePayment(double amount)
```
- Calculates interest and principal portions
- Updates remaining balance
- Tracks payment history
- Handles loan closure automatically

### Information Display
```cpp
void displayLoanInfo()
void displayPaymentSchedule()
void displayPaymentHistory()
```
- Comprehensive loan information display
- Future payment projections
- Historical payment tracking

## Compilation Instructions

### Compile Main Application
```bash
g++ -o banking_system_with_loans main.cpp banking_system_lib.cpp -std=c++11
```

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Main Application
```bash
./banking_system_with_loans
```

## Sample Usage Workflow

1. **Create a Bank Account**
   - Choose account type (Savings/Checking/Fixed Deposit)
   - Enter account details with validation
   - Set initial balance

2. **Apply for a Loan**
   - Select loan type (Personal/Home/Car/Business)
   - Enter loan amount and term
   - System calculates monthly payment
   - Loan amount deposited to account

3. **Make Loan Payments**
   - Enter loan ID
   - Specify payment amount
   - System deducts from linked account
   - Automatic interest/principal calculation

4. **Track Loan Progress**
   - View detailed loan information
   - Check payment schedule
   - Review payment history

## Mathematical Formulas Used

### Monthly Payment Calculation
```
M = P * [r(1+r)^n] / [(1+r)^n - 1]
```
Where:
- M = Monthly payment
- P = Principal loan amount
- r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 / 100)
- n = Total number of payments

### Interest/Principal Breakdown
```
Interest Portion = Remaining Balance * Monthly Interest Rate
Principal Portion = Payment Amount - Interest Portion
```

## Security Features
- Account number validation (12 characters)
- Name validation (alphabets and spaces only)
- Balance validation (non-negative)
- Loan amount validation
- Payment amount validation
- Account existence verification

## Future Enhancements
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Due date tracking and overdue notifications
- Credit score integration
- Loan approval workflow
- Multiple currency support
- Web interface
- Mobile application

## Error Handling
- Invalid input validation
- Account not found scenarios
- Insufficient funds checking
- Loan closure prevention of operations
- Comprehensive error messages

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient vector-based storage
- O(n) search operations for accounts and loans
- Memory management with proper destructors
- Minimal memory footprint

## Conclusion
This enhanced banking system provides a complete loan management solution integrated with traditional banking operations. The system is designed with extensibility in mind and can be easily enhanced with additional features.

The loan management feature demonstrates advanced C++ concepts including:
- Object-oriented design
- Polymorphism and inheritance
- STL containers and algorithms
- Mathematical computations
- User interface design
- Error handling and validation

The system is production-ready for educational purposes and can serve as a foundation for more complex financial applications.
